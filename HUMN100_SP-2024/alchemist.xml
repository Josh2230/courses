         <div>
            <p><note type="scholarNote">This section of text is about the boy's time working for the crystal merchant and his journey through this time. </note>THE <persName type="fictional">BOY</persName> HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE <persName>CRYSTAL MERCHANT</persName> for almost a month, and he could
               see that it wasn’t exactly the kind of job that would make him happy. The merchant
               spent the entire day mumbling behind the counter, telling the boy to be careful with
               the pieces and not to break anything.</p>
            <p>But he stayed with the job because the <persName type="fictional">merchant</persName>, although he was an old grouch,
               treated him fairly; the <persName>boy</persName> received a good commission for each piece he sold, and
               had already been able to put some money aside. That morning he had done some
               calculating: <span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default">if he continued to work every day as he had been, he would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep.</span></p>
            <p>“I’d like to build a display case for the crystal,” the <persName type="fictional">boy</persName> said to the <persName>merchant</persName>. “We
               could place it outside, and attract those people who pass at the bottom of the
               hill.”</p>
            <p>“I’ve never had one before,” the <persName type="fictional">merchant</persName> answered. “People will pass by and bump
               into it, and pieces will be broken.”</p>
            <p>“Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have died if we had
               come upon a snake. But that’s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds.”</p>
            <p>The <persName>merchant</persName> turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses. He was selling
               better than ever...as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had
               been one of Tangier’s major attractions.</p>
            <p>“Business has really improved,” he said to the <persName type="fictional">boy</persName>, after the customer had left. “I’m
               doing much better, <span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default">and soon you’ll be able to return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?”</span></p>
            <p><span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default">“Because we have to respond to omens,”</span> the <persName type="fictional">boy</persName> said, almost without meaning to; then
               he regretted what he had said, because the <persName>merchant</persName> had never met the <persName type="fictional">king</persName>.</p>
            <p>“<span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default">It’s called the principle of favorability, beginner’s luck. Because life wants you to achieve your Personal Legend,</span>” the old <persName>king</persName> had said.</p>
            <p>But the <persName type="fictional">merchant</persName> understood what the <persName>boy</persName> had said. The <persName type="fictional">boy’s</persName> very presence in the
               shop was an omen, and, as time passed and money was pouring into the cash drawer, he
               had no regrets about having hired the <persName>boy</persName>. The <persName type="fictional">boy</persName> was being paid more money than he
               deserved, because the <persName>merchant</persName>, thinking that sales wouldn’t amount to much, had
               offered the <persName type="fictional">boy</persName> a high commission rate. <span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default">He had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.</span></p>
            <p><span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default"><eventName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="Event" xml:space="default">“Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?”</eventName></span> he asked, to get away from the business of
               the display.</p>
            <p>“Because I’ve always heard about them,” the <persName>boy</persName> answered, saying nothing about his
               dream. The treasure was now nothing but a painful memory, and he tried to avoid
               thinking about it.</p>
            <p>“<eventName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="Event" xml:space="default">I don’t know anyone around here who would want to cross the desert just to see the Pyramids</eventName>,” said the <persName type="fictional">merchant</persName>. “They’re just a pile of stones. You could build one in
               your backyard.”</p>
            <p>“You’ve never had dreams of travel,” said the <persName>boy</persName>, turning to wait on a customer who
               had entered the shop.</p>
            <p>Two days later, the <persName type="fictional">merchant</persName> spoke to the <persName>boy</persName> about the display.</p>
            <p>“I don’t much like change,” he said. “You and I aren’t like <persName type="fictional">Hassan</persName>, that rich
               merchant. If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn’t affect him much. <span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default">But we two have to live with our mistakes.”</span></p>
            <p>That’s true enough, the <persName>boy</persName> thought, ruefully. “Why did you think we should have the
               display?”</p>
            <p>“I want to get back to my sheep faster. We have to take advantage when luck is on our
               side, and do as much to help it as it’s doing to help us. <span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default">It’s called the principle of favorability. Or beginner’s luck.”</span></p>
            <p>The <persName type="fictional">merchant</persName> was silent for a few moments. Then he said, “The Prophet gave us the
               <rs key="Qur’an" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428" cert="high" type="http://sparql.cwrc.ca/ontology/cwrc#Religion">Koran</rs>, and left us just five obligations to satisfy during our lives. <eventName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="Religion" xml:space="default">The most important is to believe only in the one true God. The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor.”</eventName></p>
            <p>He stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the Prophet. He was a
               devout man, and, even with all his impatience, he wanted to live his life in
               accordance with <rs key="Muslim" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47740" type="http://sparql.cwrc.ca/ontology/cwrc#Religion">Muslim</rs> law.</p>
            <p>“What’s the fifth obligation?” the <persName>boy</persName> asked.</p>
            <p>“Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel,” the <persName type="fictional">merchant</persName> answered.
               “<eventName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="Religion" xml:space="default">The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a pilgrimage. We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy city of <placeName key="Mecca" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5806" cert="high">Mecca<precision match="@ref" precision="high"/></placeName></eventName>.</p>
            <p>“<placeName key="Mecca" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5806">Mecca</placeName> is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was young, all I wanted to do
               was put together enough money to start this shop. I thought that someday I’d be rich,
               and could go to <placeName key="Mecca" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5806" cert="high">Mecca<precision match="@ref" precision="high"/></placeName>. I began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to
               leave someone in charge of the shop; the crystals are delicate things. At the same
               time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading for <placeName key="Mecca" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5806">Mecca</placeName>. Some of them were
               rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels, but most of the people
               making the pilgrimage were poorer than I.</p>
            <p>“All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed the symbols of the
               pilgrimage on the doors of their houses. <span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default">One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had traveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather.”</span></p>
            <p>“Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the <persName>boy</persName>.</p>
            <p><span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default">“Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’s what helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible café. I’m afraid that if my dream is realized, I’ll have no reason to go on living.</span></p>
            <p><span cert="high" evaluate="all" type="Theme" xml:space="default">“You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you’re different from me, because you want to realize your dreams. I just want to dream about Mecca. I’ve already imagined a thousand times crossing the desert, arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it. I’ve already imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in front of me, and the conversations and prayers we would share. But I’m afraid that it would all be a disappointment, so I prefer just to dream about it.”</span></p>
            <p>That day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display. Not everyone can
               see his dreams come true in the same way.</p>
         </div>

         <div>
            <p>TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED, AND THE SHELF BROUGHT many customers into the crystal shop.
               The boy estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he could return to Spain
               and buy sixty sheep, and yet another sixty. In less than a year, he would have
               doubled his flock, and he would be able to do business with the Arabs, because he was
               now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in the marketplace, he
               had never again made use of Urim and Thummim, because Egypt was now just as distant a
               dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become happy in his
               work, and thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a
               winner.</p>
            <p>“You must always know what it is that you want,” the old king had said. The boy knew,
               and was now working toward it. Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that
               strange land, met up with a thief, and doubled the size of his flock without spending
               a cent.</p>
            <p>He was proud of himself. He had learned some important things, like how to deal in
               crystal, and about the language without words...and about omens. One afternoon he had
               seen a man at the top of the hill, complaining that it was impossible to find a
               decent place to get something to drink after such a climb. The boy, accustomed to
               recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.</p>
            <p>“Let’s sell tea to the people who climb the hill.”</p>
            <p>“Lots of places sell tea around here,” the merchant said.</p>
            <p>“But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy the tea and want to
               buy the glasses. I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men.”</p>
            <p>The merchant didn’t respond, but that afternoon, after saying his prayers and closing
               the shop, he invited the boy to sit with him and share his hookah, that strange pipe
               used by the Arabs.</p>
            <p>“What is it you’re looking for?” asked the old merchant.</p>
            <p>“I’ve already told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to earn the money to
               do so.”</p>
            <p>The merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled deeply.</p>
            <p>“I’ve had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad, and everything
               else there is to know about crystal. I know its dimensions and how it behaves. If we
               serve tea in crystal, the shop is going to expand. And then I’ll have to change my
               way of life.”</p>
            <p>“Well, isn’t that good?”</p>
            <p>“I’m already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was thinking about how
               much time I had wasted in the same place, while my friends had moved on, and either
               went bankrupt or did better than they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I
               can see that it hasn’t been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always wanted it
               to be. I don’t want to change anything, because I don’t know how to deal with change.
               I’m used to the way I am.”</p>
            <p>The boy didn’t know what to say. The old man continued, “You have been a real
               blessing to me. Today, I understand something I didn’t see before: every blessing
               ignored becomes a curse. I don’t want anything else in life. But you are forcing me
               to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and
               now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I’m going to feel worse than I did
               before you arrived. Because I know the things I should be able to accomplish, and I
               don’t want to do so.”</p>
            <p>It’s good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa, thought the boy to
               himself.</p>
            <p>They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set. They were
               conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of himself for being able to do so. There
               had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed
               to know about the world. But they could never have taught him Arabic.</p>
            <p>There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can’t teach me, thought
               the boy as he regarded the old merchant. All they ever do, really, is look for food
               and water. And maybe it wasn’t that they were teaching me, but that I was learning
               from them.</p>
            <p>“Maktub,” the merchant said, finally.</p>
            <p>“What does that mean?”</p>
            <p>“You would have to have been born an Arab to understand,” he answered. “But in your
               language it would be something like ‘It is written.’”</p>
            <p>And, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy that he could begin to
               sell tea in the crystal glasses. Sometimes, there’s just no way to hold back the
               river.</p>
         </div>

         <div>
            <p>THE MEN CLIMBED THE HILL, AND THEY WERE TIRED when they reached the top. But there
               they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea. They went in to drink the
               tea, which was served in beautiful crystal glasses.</p>
            <p>“My wife never thought of this,” said one, and he bought some crystal—he was
               entertaining guests that night, and the guests would be impressed by the beauty of
               the glassware. The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was
               served in crystal, because the aroma was retained. The third said that it was a
               tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical
               powers.</p>
            <p>Before long, the news spread, and a great many people began to climb the hill to see
               the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old. Other shops were
               opened that served tea in crystal, but they weren’t at the top of a hill, and they
               had little business.</p>
            <p>Eventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees. He began to import enormous
               quantities of tea, along with his crystal, and his shop was sought out by men and
               women with a thirst for things new.</p>
            <p>And, in that way, the months passed.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN. IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first
               set foot on the African continent.</p>
            <p>He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought especially for this day. He
               put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin. Wearing his
               new sandals, he descended the stairs silently.</p>
            <p>The city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea
               from a crystal glass. Then he sat in the sun-filled doorway, smoking the hookah.</p>
            <p>He smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the sound of the wind
               that brought the scent of the desert. When he had finished his smoke, he reached into
               one of his pockets, and sat there for a few moments, regarding what he had
               withdrawn.</p>
            <p>It was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and twenty sheep, a return
               ticket, and a license to import products from Africa into his own country.</p>
            <p>He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop. Then the two went
               off to have some more tea.</p>
            <p>“I’m leaving today,” said the boy. “I have the money I need to buy my sheep. And you
               have the money you need to go to Mecca.”</p>
            <p>The old man said nothing.</p>
            <p>“Will you give me your blessing?” asked the boy. “You have helped me.” The man
               continued to prepare his tea, saying nothing. Then he turned to the boy.</p>
            <p>“I am proud of you,” he said. “You brought a new feeling into my crystal shop. But
               you know that I’m not going to go to Mecca. Just as you know that you’re not going to
               buy your sheep.”</p>
            <p>“Who told you that?” asked the boy, startled. “Maktub,” said the old crystal
               merchant. And he gave the boy his blessing.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS. They filled three sacks. As he
               was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room, his old shepherd’s pouch. It was
               bunched up, and he had hardly thought of it for a long time. As he took his jacket
               out of the pouch, thinking to give it to someone in the street, the two stones fell
               to the floor. Urim and Thummim.</p>
            <p>It made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize how long it had
               been since he had thought of him. For nearly a year, he had been working incessantly,
               thinking only of putting aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with
               pride.</p>
            <p>“Never stop dreaming,” the old king had said. “Follow the omens.”</p>
            <p>The boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the strange sensation that
               the old king was nearby. He had worked hard for a year, and the omens were that it
               was time to go.</p>
            <p>I’m going to go back to doing just what I did before, the boy thought. Even though
               the sheep didn’t teach me to speak Arabic.</p>
            <p>But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language
               in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the
               time that he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was the language of
               enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for
               something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange city, and he felt
               that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.</p>
            <p>“When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it,” the old
               king had said.</p>
            <p>But the old king hadn’t said anything about being robbed, or about endless deserts,
               or about people who know what their dreams are but don’t want to realize them. The
               old king hadn’t told him that the Pyramids were just a pile of stones, or that anyone
               could build one in his backyard. And he had forgotten to mention that, when you have
               enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before, you should buy
               it.</p>
            <p>The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He went down the stairs
               and found the merchant waiting on a foreign couple, while two other customers walked
               about the shop, drinking tea from crystal glasses. It was more activity than usual
               for this time of the morning. From where he stood, he saw for the first time that the
               old merchant’s hair was very much like the hair of the old king. He remembered the
               smile of the candy seller, on his first day in Tangier, when he had nothing to eat
               and nowhere to go—that smile had also been like the old king’s smile.</p>
            <p>It’s almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought. And yet, none of
               these people has ever met the old king. On the other hand, he said that he always
               appeared to help those who are trying to realize their Personal Legend.</p>
            <p>He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn’t want to cry with
               the other people there. He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had
               learned. He was more confident in himself, though, and felt as though he could
               conquer the world.</p>
            <p>“But I’m going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my flock again.” He
               said that to himself with certainty, but he was no longer happy with his decision. He
               had worked for an entire year to make a dream come true, and that dream, minute by
               minute, was becoming less important. Maybe because that wasn’t really his dream.</p>
            <p>Who knows...maybe it’s better to be like the crystal merchant: never go to Mecca, and
               just go through life wanting to do so, he thought, again trying to convince himself.
               But as he held Urim and Thummim in his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength
               and will of the old king. By coincidence—or maybe it was an omen, the boy thought—he
               came to the bar he had entered on his first day there. The thief wasn’t there, and
               the owner brought him a cup of tea.</p>
            <p>I can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I learned how to care for
               sheep, and I haven’t forgotten how that’s done. But maybe I’ll never have another
               chance to get to the Pyramids in Egypt. The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and
               he knew about my past. He really was a king, a wise king. The hills of Andalusia were
               only two hours away, but there was an entire desert between him and the Pyramids. Yet
               the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two
               hours closer to his treasure...the fact that the two hours had stretched into an
               entire year didn’t matter. I know why I want to get back to my flock, he thought. I
               understand sheep; they’re no longer a problem, and they can be good friends. On the
               other hand, I don’t know if the desert can be a friend, and it’s in the desert that I
               have to search for my treasure. If I don’t find it, I can always go home. I finally
               have enough money, and all the time I need. Why not?</p>
            <p>He suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back to being a shepherd. He
               could always become a crystal salesman again. Maybe the world had other hidden
               treasures, but he had a dream, and he had met with a king. That doesn’t happen to
               just anyone!</p>
            <p>He was planning as he left the bar. He had remembered that one of the crystal
               merchant’s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the
               desert. He held Urim and Thummim in his hand; because of those two stones, he was
               once again on the way to his treasure.</p>
            <p>“I am always nearby, when someone wants to realize their Personal Legend,” the old
               king had told him.</p>
            <p>What could it cost to go over to the supplier’s warehouse and find out if the
               Pyramids were really that far away?</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of animals, sweat,
               and dust; it was part warehouse, part corral. I never thought I’d end up in a place
               like this, he thought, as he leafed through the pages of a chemical journal. Ten
               years at the university, and here I am in a corral.</p>
            <p>But he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all his studies were
               aimed at finding the one true language of the universe. First he had studied
               Esperanto, then the world’s religions, and now it was alchemy. He knew how to speak
               Esperanto, he understood all the major religions well, but he wasn’t yet an
               alchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind important questions, but his studies
               had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go. He had tried in vain
               to establish a relationship with an alchemist. But the alchemists were strange
               people, who thought only about themselves, and almost always refused to help him. Who
               knows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master Work—the
               Philosopher’s Stone—and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves.</p>
            <p>He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father, fruitlessly
               seeking the Philosopher’s Stone. He had spent enormous amounts of time at the great
               libraries of the world, and had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes
               on alchemy. In one he had read that, many years ago, a famous Arabian alchemist had
               visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two hundred years old, and that he
               had discovered the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had
               been profoundly impressed by the story. But he would never have thought it more than
               just a myth, had not a friend of his—returning from an archaeological expedition in
               the desert—told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers.</p>
            <p>“He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,” his friend had said. “And people say that he is
               two hundred years old, and is able to transform any metal into gold.”</p>
            <p>The Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled all his commitments and
               pulled together the most important of his books, and now here he was, sitting inside
               a dusty, smelly warehouse. Outside, a huge caravan was being prepared for a crossing
               of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through Al- Fayoum.</p>
            <p>I’m going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman thought. And the odor of the
               animals became a bit more tolerable. </p>
            <p>A young Arab, also loaded down with baggage, entered, and greeted the Englishman.</p>
            <p>“Where are you bound?” asked the young Arab.</p>
            <p>“I’m going into the desert,” the man answered, turning back to his reading. He didn’t
               want any conversation at this point. What he needed to do was review all he had
               learned over the years, because the alchemist would certainly put him to the
               test.</p>
            <p>The young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book was written in Spanish.
               That’s good, thought the Englishman. He spoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if
               this boy was going to Al- Fayoum, there would be someone to talk to when there were
               no other important things to do.</p>
